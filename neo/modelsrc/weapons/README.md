# Weapon model sources

The Tachi viewmodels are the first weapons maintained under these conventions.
Expect the folder layout, scripts and steps here to change as more weapons are added.

Each model has a source folder here, such as `jinrai_tachi/`, containing one `.blend` file and one `.qc` file.
The scripts take the names of the source folders to work on.


## Exporting animations

To export from Blender to SMD, for example for both Tachi projects, run:

```sh
blender --background --python-exit-code 1 --python export_viewmodels.py -- jinrai_tachi nsf_tachi
```


## Compiling models

Set `--compiler` to Source SDK Base 2013 Multiplayer's `studiomdl.exe`, and `--game` to the neo game directory containing `gameinfo.txt`:

```sh
python compile_viewmodels.py jinrai_tachi nsf_tachi --compiler "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Source SDK Base 2013 Multiplayer/bin/studiomdl.exe" --game "C:/path/to/neo/game/neo"
```

To save the compiled models in neoAssets, copy the generated files (`v_*_tachi.*` for the Tachi) from the neo game directory's `models/weapons/` folder to `neo/models/weapons/`.
